# ANNOTATIONS
Here you can find all the annotations that we did over the videos.
## HEURISTIC
We had considered each movement which differs to the previous one in terms of which part of the body is moved (legs, arms, or head).
For instance if the subject moves the leg, and then it moves an arm, hence we put a segment in the middle of the two actions.
If a subject stops in doing a certain action, then we put a segment just before the finish of the action.
