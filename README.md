# TesiMag
This is the main directory, you can find the annotations and the data which are cleaned by NAN values.
We left in this directory also the Report that you can check for being updated about the work in progress. 
Once we have new finished work we will upload them here (e.g. the ML algorithm used over the data and all the supporting python files)
